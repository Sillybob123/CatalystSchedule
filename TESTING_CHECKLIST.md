## If Tests Fail

### Debugging Steps:

1. **Check Console Output**
   - Look for red errors
   - Verify subscription initialization
   - Check for "already setup" message

2. **Check Debug Console**
   - Should show real-time updates
   - Look for error messages (‚ùå)
   - Verify render triggers (üé®)

3. **Check Network Tab**
   - Verify Firestore requests succeed
   - Look for 200 status codes
   - Check for any failed requests

4. **Common Issues**
   - **Subscriptions not running**: Check script load order in HTML
   - **No UI updates**: Check currentView variable
   - **Duplicate items**: Multiple subscriptions running
   - **Missing data**: Firestore permissions issue

5. **Get Help**
   - Save console logs
   - Screenshot debug console
   - Note which specific test failed
   - Check SAVE_FIX_EXPLANATION.md for details

## Notes

- All tests should be performed in order
- Use Chrome or Firefox for best DevTools
- Keep debug console open during testing
- Clear browser cache between test sessions
- Test with different user roles if possible (admin, editor, writer)
