## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Permission denied" error

**Solution:**
1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project "catalystmonday"
3. Click "Firestore Database" ‚Üí "Rules" tab
4. Make sure line 27 says: `allow create: if request.auth != null;`
5. Click "Publish"

### Issue: Proposal doesn't appear after saving

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
3. The proposal should be in "Pending Approval" column
4. If still not visible, check Firestore Console to see if document was created

### Issue: Button stuck on "Submitting..."

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Ensure you have internet connection
3. Refresh the page and try again

## Verify Firestore Rules

Your Firestore security rules MUST include:

```javascript
// Projects collection
match /projects/{projectId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow create: if request.auth != null;  // ‚Üê THIS LINE IS CRITICAL
  allow update: if request.auth != null && (
    isAdmin() ||
    isAuthor(resource.data) ||
    isEditor(resource.data) ||
    (request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['timeline', 'activity']))
  );
  allow delete: if isAdmin() || isAuthor(resource.data);
}
```
