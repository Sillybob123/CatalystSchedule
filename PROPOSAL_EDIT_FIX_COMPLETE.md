# Proposal Edit Fix - Complete Implementation

## Problem
Writers were unable to edit their proposals after posting them. The HTML had edit buttons in the details modal, but there was no JavaScript functionality to actually handle the editing.

## Solution
Created a new JavaScript file `proposalEditFix.js` that provides complete proposal editing functionality.

## Files Modified

### 1. NEW FILE: proposalEditFix.js
**Location:** `/Users/yairben-dor/XCode/CatalystSchedule-main/proposalEditFix.js`

This file contains three key functions:

#### enableProposalEditing()
- Converts the proposal paragraph into an editable textarea
- Stores the original text for cancel functionality
- Shows Save and Cancel buttons, hides Edit button
- Automatically focuses the textarea and moves cursor to end

#### disableProposalEditing(options)
- Converts textarea back to paragraph
- Can revert to original text or keep edited text
- Shows Edit button, hides Save and Cancel buttons

#### handleSaveProposal()
- Validates the edited proposal (minimum 10 characters)
- Checks if user has permission (must be author or admin)
- Saves to Firestore with activity tracking
- Updates local project object for immediate UI update
- Shows success/error notifications
- Handles all error cases (permission denied, not found, etc.)

## Files Updated

### 2. MODIFIED: dashboard.html
**Location:** `/Users/yairben-dor/XCode/CatalystSchedule-main/dashboard.html`

**Change:** Added script tag to load the new proposal edit functionality
```html
<script src="proposalEditFix.js?v=1"></script>
```

## How It Works

### For Writers (Proposal Authors)
1. Open any proposal they created
2. Click the "Edit" button next to the proposal heading
3. Proposal text becomes editable in a textarea
4. Make changes to the proposal
5. Click "Save" to save changes, or "Cancel" to discard

### For Admins
- Same functionality as writers
- Can edit any proposal (not just their own)

### Security & Permissions
- Only the original author or an admin can edit proposals
- Permission checks happen both in UI and before Firestore update
- All edits are logged in the activity feed

### User Experience
- Edit button only shows for users who have permission
- Smooth transition between view and edit modes
- Clear visual feedback (blue border on textarea)
- Success/error notifications for all actions
- Cancel button reverts to original text

## Technical Details

### Firestore Updates
When a proposal is saved, the following is updated in Firestore:
```javascript
{
  proposal: newProposalText,
  updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
  activity: arrayUnion({
    text: 'updated the proposal',
    authorName: currentUserName,
    timestamp: new Date()
  })
}
```

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling for:
- Permission denied
- Project not found
- Database unavailable
- Invalid input
- Network errors

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers
- Uses standard DOM APIs
- No special dependencies

## Testing Checklist

✅ Writer can edit their own proposals  
✅ Writer cannot edit others' proposals  
✅ Admin can edit any proposal  
✅ Edit button shows only for authorized users  
✅ Save button validates minimum length  
✅ Cancel button reverts changes  
✅ Changes save to Firestore correctly  
✅ Activity feed logs the edit  
✅ Success notification shows on save  
✅ Error notification shows on failure  
✅ Textarea auto-focuses when entering edit mode  
✅ UI updates immediately after save  

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Rich Text Editor**: Add formatting options (bold, italics, lists)
2. **Auto-save Draft**: Save draft in localStorage as user types
3. **Edit History**: Show previous versions of proposals
4. **Character Counter**: Display current length vs maximum
5. **Markdown Support**: Allow markdown formatting
6. **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time updates when multiple users view

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firestore security rules allow updates
3. Confirm user is logged in correctly
4. Check that proposal ID is being set correctly

## Version
**v1.0** - Initial implementation (October 22, 2025)
